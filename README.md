aiohttp
-------

This Bot application is build using `aiohttp`, an asynchronous web server/client
framework for Python 3.5+.  If you are unfamiliar with asynchronous programming in
Python (namely, Python 3.5+'s `asyncio`), then you should read up on it here:

- https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html
- https://realpython.com/async-io-python/

The `aiohttp` package provides a web server and client that uses this fundamental
`asyncio` functionality.  To learn more about `aiohttp`, you can read up on it here:
